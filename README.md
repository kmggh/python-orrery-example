python-orrery-example
=====================

For a long time, basically since the beginning of Java,  I've used a simple orrery program, based on Kepler's Law
as my ``Hello World'' for any new programming language, particularly an OO one.

This is sucn an exercise for Python.


To run
======

    ./orrery.py --help
    ./orrery.py
